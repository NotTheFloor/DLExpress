# Interactive Line Segment Node System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented a sophisticated interactive node system that allows users to manipulate line segments through visual waypoint and midpoint nodes. When lines are selected, users can see and interact with movable nodes to reshape line paths dynamically.

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Node Types
1. **Waypoint Nodes (Circles)**
   - 6px radius filled circles at existing waypoints
   - Colors: Gray (normal), White (hover), Theme color (dragging)
   - Always draggable to reshape line segments

2. **Midpoint Nodes (Squares)**
   - 8x8px filled squares at segment midpoints  
   - Colors: Semi-transparent gray (normal), Theme color (dragging)
   - Create new waypoints when dragged

### Interaction States
- **Line Unselected**: No nodes visible
- **Line Selected**: All nodes appear (waypoint + midpoint nodes)
- **Node Hover**: Visual feedback with color/border changes
- **Node Dragging**: Theme-colored appearance, real-time line updates

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### InteractiveWaypoint Class
```python
@dataclass
class InteractiveWaypoint:
    position: Tuple[float, float]
    is_user_created: bool = False  # XML vs user-created
    node_id: str = ""              # Unique identifier
```

**Key Features**:
- Distinguishes between XML waypoints and user-created waypoints
- Provides coordinate access (`x`, `y` properties)
- Supports position updates and distance calculations
- Unique ID generation for tracking

### LineNodeManager Class
**Responsibilities**:
- Creates and manages visual node representations
- Handles node visibility based on selection state
- Processes drag interactions and waypoint modifications
- Implements automatic segment merging logic

**Key Methods**:
- `create_nodes()` - Generate waypoint and midpoint nodes
- `show_nodes()` / `hide_nodes()` - Control visibility
- `split_segment_at_midpoint()` - Create new waypoints
- `check_for_merges()` - Remove unnecessary waypoints

### Enhanced MultiSegmentArrow
**New Capabilities**:
- Dynamic waypoint management (add/remove/move)
- Node manager integration
- Real-time geometry updates during dragging
- Support for both XML and user-created waypoints

**Key Methods**:
- `get_interactive_waypoints()` - Access waypoint list
- `add_waypoint_at_index()` - Insert new waypoints
- `remove_waypoint()` - Delete waypoints
- `show_nodes()` / `hide_nodes()` - Control node visibility

## 🎯 User Interaction Flow

### 1. Line Selection
```
User clicks line → SelectionManager.select_item() 
                → MultiSegmentArrow.show_nodes()
                → LineNodeManager.create_nodes()
                → Nodes appear on line
```

### 2. Waypoint Movement
```
User drags waypoint node → WaypointNode.mouseMoveEvent()
                        → InteractiveWaypoint.move_to()
                        → LineNodeManager.on_waypoint_moved()
                        → MultiSegmentArrow.updateGeometry()
                        → Real-time line update
```

### 3. Segment Splitting
```
User drags midpoint node → MidpointNode.mouseMoveEvent()
                        → LineNodeManager.split_segment_at_midpoint()
                        → Create new InteractiveWaypoint
                        → MultiSegmentArrow.add_waypoint_at_index()
                        → Recreate all nodes with new waypoint
```

### 4. Segment Merging
```
User releases waypoint → LineNodeManager.check_for_merges()
                      → Calculate straightness (angle + distance)
                      → Remove waypoint if straight enough
                      → MultiSegmentArrow.remove_waypoint()
                      → Update line geometry
```

## 📐 Merging Algorithms

### Angle-Based Detection
- **Method**: Calculate angle between consecutive line segments
- **Threshold**: < 5° deviation (vectors point in same direction)
- **Logic**: `angle_between_vectors < merge_threshold`

### Distance-Based Detection  
- **Method**: Calculate perpendicular distance from waypoint to direct line
- **Threshold**: < 10 pixels from straight path
- **Logic**: `point_to_line_distance < distance_threshold`

### Merge Conditions
- **Either** angle OR distance criteria must be met
- **Only** user-created waypoints can be merged (preserves XML waypoints)
- **Real-time** checking during waypoint drag completion

## 🔗 Integration Points

### Selection System Integration
- **SelectionManager** automatically shows/hides nodes on line selection
- **Theme-aware** node colors adapt to light/dark mode
- **Coordinated** with existing entity selection system

### Scene Management Integration

- **Dynamic updates** when switching between workflows
- **Memory management** for node creation/destruction

### XML Compatibility

## 🔮 Usage Example

```python
# User workflow:
1. User selects line          → Waypoint and midpoint nodes appear
2. User drags waypoint       → Line reshapes in real-time  
3. User drags midpoint       → Creates new waypoint, splits segment
4. User moves waypoint near  → Segments auto-merge when straight
   straight line
5. User deselects line       → All nodes disappear cleanly
```
